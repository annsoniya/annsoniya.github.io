I am an instrumentation engineer who pivoted to neuroscience, bringing a unique engineering mindset to understand the brain. My research investigates how the brain decodes sound sequences.

Wet-Lab Experiments: I perform advanced in vivo techniques in mice, including two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology.

EEG Experiments: I also leverage my background as an instrumentation engineer to design novel EEG tasks and build robust data analysis pipelines.

Computational Modelling: Develop a recurrent neural network using the Wilson-Cowan framework to explain the neural data.
