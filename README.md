I am a graduate student pursuing my PhD in systems neuroscience from the **Information Processing Laboratory** at **[IIT Kharagpur]**, under the guidance of **Dr. Sharba Bandyopadhyay**. My background as an instrumentation engineer gives me a unique perspective on neuroscience, where my research investigates how the brain decodes complex sound sequences.

* **Wet-Lab Experiments:** I perform advanced *in vivo* techniques in mice, including two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology.

* **EEG Experiments:** I leverage my background as an Instrumentation engineer to design novel EEG tasks and build robust data analysis pipelines.

* **Computational Modelling:** I develop recurrent neural network models using the Wilson-Cowan framework to explain the neural data.
